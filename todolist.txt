things to add from langford
add classification column config and classification column to retention list (3 columns)

my idea
what about a "metadata column configured by library in each site? that gets copied to "library metadata column" would need a doc library settings page and another column in approval list


NB workflow instance name for expiry must match whats in code "ExpiryWF"

need to learn about noconflict, loading jquery  without conflicting with another version using custom action
need to have some sort of key on config screen
make expiry wf work for non-records
